# You have seven day to archive all J-Pop albums.
# Each day contains 24 hours.
# Run out of days and remain behind as Mall leaves without arching its J-Pop albums. And earth is destroyed by an apocalyptic Volcano.

# There are 130 J-Pop albums of crucial importance, and you can exchange each able to archivists for cash.
# In situations of duplicate albums, you get to keep that album. Collect all duplicates to unlock in game "OVAs".

# There are four intrative states: Steal, Stab, Shoot,

# You can stab enemies whom try to shoot you, but you can steal their gun. They can stab you to prevent you from stealing their gun.

# You have  10 HP, 4 ATK, and 2 Heal
# Enemy has 10 HP, 4 ATK, and 2 Heal
# Run out of HP and you die, must restart.
# They run out of HP, you continue with an hours decrement.
# Run out of hours in a day and you lose a day.
